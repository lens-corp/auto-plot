# Autoplotter
### About our project
Autoplotter is a Slack app that allows you to load any CSV, TXT, or NPY dataset and begin exploratory data analysis. It offers a variety of visualisations, statistical data analysis, and producing a variety of plots based on the data in the file. Autoplotter can create a wide range of charts, histograms, count plots, 3D scatter plots, and subplots, among other things. The best part about Autoplotter is that it was created so you don't have to waste time writing code for data analysis or producing various types of visual analysis; instead, Autoplotter can handle it all in a few clicks. It is more faster and features a user-friendly interface that allows the user to download files based on their needs. The output consists of separate zip files for Univariate, Bivariate, and Miscellaneous plots.
